# Season and Temperature Comparison

This Python code allows you to perform two scenarios:

1. **Finding the season of the year** based on a given country name and month of the year.
2. **Comparing temperature readings** with the average temperature of a city at a specific time (morning or evening).

## Scenario A: Finding the season of the year

The `find_season(country, month)` function takes a country name and month as input and returns the corresponding season. The seasons are defined for certain countries and variations within those countries.

To use this functionality, call the `find_season` function and provide the country and month as arguments. The function will return the season for the given country and month.

## Scenario B: Comparing temperature readings

The `compare_temperature(city, temperature, time)` function allows you to compare a given temperature reading with the average temperature of a city at a specific time (morning or evening). If the temperature difference is more than 5 degrees Celsius, an additional message will be provided.

To use this functionality, call the `compare_temperature` function and provide the city, temperature, and time as arguments. The function will compare the temperature with the average temperature for the given city and time and return the result.
